# L33ter

L33ter is a Golang tool to manipulate text files containing words and creating a new text file containing both the original words
and their "l33t" version. Can be usful when trying to create a blacklist to prevent specific passwords in multiple ways of writing.

## How to use it
(you should have GO installed: https://golang.org/dl/)

First, build an executable file:
```
go build L33ter.go 
```
Second, run the tool with the needed flags (windows .exe for this example):
```
L33ter.exe -input INPUT_FILE -output OUTPUT_FILE
```

 
### Compatibility
Go can be compiled for all the platforms

### Example
Running without any flags:

### Issues, bugs and other code-issues
Yeah, I know, this code isn't the best. I'm fine with it as I'm not a developer and this is part of my learning process.
If there is an option to do some of it better, please, let me know.

_Not how many, but where._
